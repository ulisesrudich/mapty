# 🗺️ Mapty - Workout Tracker (Portfolio Project)

A simple workout tracking web app built with **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**, using the **Leaflet API**.  
It allows users to log **running** or **cycling** workouts directly on an **interactive map**, view their workout history, and navigate between them.

## 🚀 How To Use

### 🌎 Geolocation
- The app requests your location on load to center the map on your current position (required to use the app).  

### 📍 Interactive map
- Click anywhere on the map to open a form and log a new workout.  

### 🏃 Running & Cycling
- Choose the workout type and fill in all the inputs.  

### 📝 Workout logging
- After submitting the form, a marker is rendered on the map and a card in the sidebar (with the workout details).  

### ♻️ Persistent history
- Logged workouts are saved in localStorage, so they remain available even after reloading or closing the page.  

### 🧭 Quick navigation
- Clicking a workout card will pan the map to the corresponding marker.
